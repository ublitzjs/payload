# @ublitzjs/req-body package for parsing request payloads

This package lets you parse payload coming from http requests ( + multipart). Functions are of 2 types - simple and 'basic' (has little more functionality).

## parseSimpleBody and parseFormDataBody

(sorry, docs are now incomplete. Look into <a href="./index.d.ts">TS declaration file</a> for more)

(and also importing "@ublitzjs/payload/ws" gives you 2 special high-performant cross-platform functions for easier handling of websocket messages)
